## Our new article on the ice project has been accepted.
###### Jul. 10, 2024

Achieving a tunable coupled ultrasonic non-destructive test requires reliable prediction of the elastic wave properties of the coupled medium. Our article develops a new scheme based on Green's function, with an emphasis on numerical dispersion and dissipation in the homogenization process. This is ideal for bridging the gap between numerical wave modeling and established analytical statistical approaches.

## New collabrated article on printing concrete modeling is online now.
###### May 6, 2024

Our article titled "Modeling Concrete Deposition via 3D Printing Using the Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM)" has been published in Cement and Concrete Research and is now available online. This work highlights the advantages and possibilities of using RKPM for viscous flow modeling.
